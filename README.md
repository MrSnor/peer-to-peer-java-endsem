## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

```
netstat -aon
```

## Run Project

Here are the steps to run your project:

1. **Open MyMain.java**: Navigate to the file `MyMain.java` in your project directory.
2. **Run the Main Function**: Run the `main` function in `MyMain.java`. This will start the project.
3. **Choose an Option**: You will be prompted to choose an option:
   - **1. To run the Server**: Choose this option to start the server.
   - **2. To run the Client**: Choose this option to start the client.

4. **Follow the Prompts**: Depending on your choice, follow the prompts to complete the setup.

## Screenshots

1. Run the `server` and moniter the files available at the clients in *real-time*:

3. Run client 2 and download a file from another client:
